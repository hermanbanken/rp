# Reactive Programming
by Herman Banken

"Reactive Programming is a new term", were the first words of a [paper from 1959](http://www.jstor.org/stable/1235239?seq=2#page_scan_tab_contents), in the Journal of Farm Economics. The author was speaking about a mathematical concept however and had little to do with the definition "Reactive Programming" in the context of programming languages, first mentioned in 1989 by Berry:

> "Reactive programs continuously interact with their environment, at a speed determined by the environment instead of the program itself." - GÃ©rard Berry, 1989

The term "reactive" seems hotter than ever, and curiously people still think that it is something new. In 2015 Andre Staltz wrote "[..] this new thing called Reactive Programming" and he is not the only one: it is new to more and more people. But Reactive Programming (RP) exists in many different shapes, and it is important to know the differences.

After working with Reactive technologies for some time it becomes natural, but it can be a hard concept to grasp. In this blog I will try to get you up to speed on the general subject and explain the forms, so you can use it too.

## Intro
When writing an application your program is generally interacted with by humans or remote systems. For example your program could be notified of a button click:

> JS / Scala button click callback-style sample

Ho


Update & check loop
System controlled by environment
Callback hell


Dual of iterator

## Code style: transparent/explicit

## Pure? Functional?

## Glitches

## Hot 'n Cold


# Extra's
Bonus goodies :)

## Rx's Duality to Enumerable
