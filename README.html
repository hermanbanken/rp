<h1>Reactive Programming
<small>by Herman Banken</small>
</h1>

<p>"Reactive Programming is a new term", were the first words of a <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/1235239?seq=2#page_scan_tab_contents">paper from 1959</a>, in the Journal of Farm Economics. The author was speaking about a mathematical concept however and had little to do with the definition "Reactive Programming" in the context of programming languages, first mentioned in 1989 by Berry:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Reactive programs continuously interact with their environment, at a speed determined by the environment instead of the program itself." - GÃ©rard Berry, 1989</p></blockquote>

<p>The term "reactive" seems hotter than ever, and curiously people still think that it is something new. In 2015 Andre Staltz wrote "[..] this new thing called Reactive Programming" and he is not the only one: it is new to more and more people. But Reactive Programming (RP) exists in many different shapes, and it is important to know the differences.</p>

<p>After working with Reactive technologies for some time it becomes natural, but it can be a hard concept to grasp. In this blog I will try to get you up to speed on the general subject and explain the forms, so you can use it too.</p>

<h2>Intro</h2>

<p>When writing an application your program is generally interacted with by humans or remote systems. For example your program could be notified of a button click:</p>

<blockquote><p>JS / Scala button click callback-style sample</p></blockquote>

<p>Update &amp; check loop
System controlled by environment
Callback hell</p>

<p>Dual of iterator</p>

<h2>Code style: transparent/explicit</h2>

<h2>Pure? Functional?</h2>

<h2>Glitches</h2>

<h2>Hot 'n Cold</h2>

<h1>Extra's</h1>

<p>Bonus goodies :)</p>

<h2>Rx's Duality to Enumerable</h2>
