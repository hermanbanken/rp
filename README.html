<h1>Reactive Programming
<small>by Herman Banken</small>
</h1>

<p>"Reactive Programming is a new term", were the first words of a <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/1235239?seq=2#page_scan_tab_contents">paper from 1959</a>, in the Journal of Farm Economics. The author was speaking about a mathematical concept however and had little to do with the definition "Reactive Programming" in the context of programming languages, first mentioned in 1989 by Berry:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Reactive programs continuously interact with their environment, at a speed determined by the environment instead of the program itself." - GÃ©rard Berry, 1989</p></blockquote>

<p>The term "reactive" seems hotter than ever, and curiously people still think that it is something new. In 2015 Andre Staltz wrote "[..] this new thing called Reactive Programming" and he is not the only one: it is new to more and more people. But Reactive Programming (RP) exists in many different shapes, and it is important to know the differences.</p>

<p>After working with Reactive technologies for some time it becomes natural, but it can be a hard concept to grasp. In this blog I will try to get you up to speed on the general subject and explain the forms, so you can use it too.</p>

<h2>Intro</h2>

<p>When writing an application your program is generally interacted with by humans or remote systems. For example your program could be notified of a form submit:</p>

<div data-code="sample-1"></div>

This is a simple example, but things get complicated easily. 
For example, when this form is a search form, with live updates, over AJAX.
Of course we do not want to overload the server and do requests that are not necessary: we should debounce the keypresses. 
For example with a timeout. 
Furthermore we need to make sure that only the last search gets displayed, 
and not have a search that got delayed overwrite a more recent one.

<div data-code="sample-2"></div>

A lot is happening in this sample, and you can see that the traditional style sample becomes cluttered already. 
A lot of state is exposed, and almost nothing of the code is reusable. 
In contrast to the Rx example which is really expressive, clean and reusable. 
On the other hand in the Rx example we see some operators that might seem a little magical at first:

<ul>
  <li>
    <a>pluck</a> extracts fields from objects. 
    <code class="language-js">pluck('target', 'value')</code> simply means that
    <code class="language-js">input['target']['value']</code> is extracted,
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/debounce.html">debounce</a> delays all subsequent actions, and ignores events that are followed with another event within that delay,</li>
  <li><a href="http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/distinct.html">distinctUntilChanged</a> only propagates events if the value changed,</li>
  <li><a href="http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/flatmap.html">flatMap</a> accepts a function which returns an Observable itself, so for each event a stream of events is created, and merged into a single stream as a result. 
  The flatMapLatest function is a special kind of flatMap, which makes sure only the last input event generates output events, canceling previous event streams.</li>
</ul>

<p>Update &amp; check loop
System controlled by environment
Callback hell</p>

<p>Dual of iterator</p>
