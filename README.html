<h1>Reactive Programming
<small>by Herman Banken</small>
</h1>

<p>"Reactive Programming is a new term", were the first words of a <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/1235239?seq=2#page_scan_tab_contents">paper from 1959</a>, in the Journal of Farm Economics. The author was speaking about a mathematical concept however and had little to do with the definition "Reactive Programming" in the context of programming languages, first mentioned in 1989 by Berry:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Reactive programs continuously interact with their environment, at a speed determined by the environment instead of the program itself." - GÃ©rard Berry, 1989</p></blockquote>

<p>The term "reactive" seems hotter than ever, and curiously people still think that it is something new. In 2015 Andre Staltz wrote "[..] this new thing called Reactive Programming" and he is not the only one: it is new to more and more people. But Reactive Programming (RP) exists in many different shapes, and it is important to know the differences.</p>

<p>After working with Reactive technologies for some time it becomes natural, but it can be a hard concept to grasp. In this blog I will try to get you up to speed on the general subject and explain the forms, so you can use it too.</p>

<h2>Events and Behaviours</h2>

<p>
At the core of <a href="">classical functional reactive programming</a> are the concepts of Events and Behaviours.
When writing a reactive application your program is generally interacted with by humans or remote systems. These interactions trigger events in the system, which allow the system to process new information, recompute or update the UI for example.
Formally events represent a sequence of discrete events as a timestamped list of values:</p>

<p><center>Events &alpha; = [(Time, &alpha;)]</center></p>

<p>
Behaviours are continuous and time-varying values. For example analog position, velocity or acceleration, the temperature, or time itself, are behaviours. They can be represented as a function from time to a value:
</p>

<p><center>Behaviour &alpha; = Time &#8594; &alpha;</center></p>

<p>
There exists an isomorphism between Events and Behaviours, as shown by 
<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.63.4658&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Hudak et al.</a>, 
converting form discrete to continuous time:
</p>

<p><center>Event &alpha; &#8776; Behaviour ( Maybe &alpha; )</center></p>

<p>
When viewed from a more practical viewpoint the reverse also holds. 
Continuous values, behaviours, when modeled in the computer are really discrete values or samples, so Behaviours are represented as very fast firing Events.
There is an actual maximum frequency at which the data is needed:
the input is received only at the sample speed of the sensors and 
the system can only display the results to the screen at a maximum of the refresh rate of the monitor or a given output rate to other outputs.
This even allows for optimization by not firing an event when the sampled value did not change.

<h2>Signal</h2>

A core concept in Reactive Programming is an Event, the notion of some external interaction with the system



For example your program could be notified of a form submit:</p>

<div data-code="sample-1"></div>

This is a simple example, but things get complicated easily. 
For example, when this form is a search form, with live updates, over AJAX.
Of course we do not want to overload the server and do requests that are not necessary: we should debounce the keypresses. 
For example with a timeout. 
Furthermore we need to make sure that only the last search gets displayed, 
and not have a search that got delayed overwrite a more recent one.

<div data-code="sample-2"></div>

A lot is happening in this sample, and you can see that the traditional style sample becomes cluttered already. 
A lot of state is exposed, and almost nothing of the code is reusable. 
In contrast to the Rx example which is really expressive, clean and reusable. 
On the other hand in the Rx example we see some operators that might seem a little magical at first:

<ul>
  <li>
    <a>pluck</a> extracts fields from objects. 
    <code class="language-js">pluck('target', 'value')</code> simply means that
    <code class="language-js">input['target']['value']</code> is extracted,
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/debounce.html">debounce</a> delays all subsequent actions, and ignores events that are followed with another event within that delay,</li>
  <li><a href="http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/distinct.html">distinctUntilChanged</a> only propagates events if the value changed,</li>
  <li><a href="http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/flatmap.html">flatMap</a> accepts a function which returns an Observable itself, so for each event a stream of events is created, and merged into a single stream as a result. 
  The flatMapLatest function is a special kind of flatMap, which makes sure only the last input event generates output events, canceling previous event streams.</li>
</ul>
